I am an electronics engineer turned coder with experience in building analytical solutions to address increasingly complex business questions related to data - storage, processing, cleaning, etc. I work with huge and disparate data sets and develop the data pipelines using a variety of technologies such as -

BigData - HDFS, Spark, and Hive
RDBMS - MySQL
Programming Language - Python & Shell Scripting, basic knowledge of Java
ALM Tools - JIRA
CI/CD - Git, BitBucket
File Systems - Unix, HDFS
Analysis tools - MS Excel, Jupyter Notebook

While my interests and areas of learning include Big Data, Data Science, and analytics, I am also a keen learner of software development and I am currently learning to contribute to open source projects on GitHub.

When not dabbling with some kind of data, I spend time watching movies, playing cricket, and photography.
