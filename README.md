I am an electronics engineer turned coder with experience in building analytical solutions to address increasingly complex business questions related to data - storage, processing, cleaning, etc. I work with huge and disparate data sets and develop data pipelines using a variety of technologies such as 

- BigData - HDFS, Spark, and Hive
- Cloud Skills - AWS Lambda, S3, ECR, Cloudwatch, Glue Data Catalog, Athena, Cloudformation
- RDBMS - Oracle
- Programming Language - Python & Shell Scripting, basic knowledge of Java
- ALM Tools - JIRA, Confluence
- CI Skills - Git, BitBucket, GitHub Actions
- File Systems - Unix, HDFS
- Analysis tools - MS Excel, Jupyter Notebook

While my interests and areas of learning include Big Data, Data Science, and analytics, I am also a keen learner of software development and I am currently learning to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub.

When not dabbling with some kind of data, I spend time watching movies, playing cricket, and photography.
